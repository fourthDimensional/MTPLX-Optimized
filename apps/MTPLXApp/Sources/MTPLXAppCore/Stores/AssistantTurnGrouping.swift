//
// The transcript's render unit for one logical assistant TURN. A turn
// with web search persists as several ChatMessages (assistant-with-
// tool_calls, tool results, ... , final assistant answer); rendering
// them individually is what produced the "wall of thinking bubbles"
// the 2026-07-02 chat-UX pass removed. This grouping folds a whole
// turn back into: one combined reasoning stream, one set of tool
// traces, one answer message, one deduped sources list.
//
// Grouping is presentation-only — persistence and the request wire
// shape are untouched, so replays/retries see exactly what the model
// actually emitted.
