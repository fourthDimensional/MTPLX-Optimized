// MARK: - ThinkingIndicatorDots
//
// Three-dot pulse used next to "Thinking" / "Searching the web" /
// "Solving" titles while a tool call, reasoning stream, or benchmark
// problem is in flight.
//
// The cadence used to be driven by a `Timer.publish(...)` stored as a
// plain `let`. Any parent that re-rendered faster than the 0.18s tick
// (the benchmark live card flushes streamed reasoning every 80ms)
// recreated the publisher and re-subscribed before it ever fired, so
// the dots froze on screen. The second version self-animated via a
// `.repeatForever` kicked off in `.onAppear` — and leaked: SwiftUI
// cannot reliably cancel repeatForever when the view unmounts (the
// documented GaugeView pathology), so every settled turn left an
// invisible 60 Hz animation driving display cycles forever. Post-
// stream the app burned 25-50% CPU at "rest", compounding per
// completed turn (2026-08-18 sampling). This version derives the
// pulse phase from `TimelineView(.animation)` — frame scheduling is
// owned by the mounted view, so unmounting is a hard stop by
// construction. Reduce Motion pauses the schedule outright.
