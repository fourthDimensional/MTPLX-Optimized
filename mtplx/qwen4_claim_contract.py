"""Request-time DECLINE vs install-time RAISE for the armed PR #391 lane.

The problem this fixes
----------------------
An armed PR #391 flag names a fast path for a SHAPE of request: the pre-scatter
draft read wants a sampled top-k draft; the device draft chain wants
temperature > 0 at depth >= 1; device K20 wants the stock selector.  Each of
them checked those terms in a ``claim`` at the top of ``generate_mtpk`` and
RAISED when the request did not match, on the reasoning that an armed flag
which quietly ran the shipped path would make a benchmark receipt lie about
which code produced the number.

That reasoning is right for a benchmark arm and wrong for a server.  A
benchmark runs one request shape it chose; a server runs whatever arrives.
On 2026-09-02 the composed-decode-stack HumanEval gate launched a server with
``MTPLX_QWEN4_DRAFT_K20_PRESCATTER=1`` and the very first request -- HumanEval
is GREEDY -- came back HTTP 500:
``DraftK20PrescatterIneligible: the greedy device chain owns the draft read``.
Every ABBA window had been temperature 1, so no window ever reached it.  The
flag was not broken; its *contract* was: a precondition that raises turns
every ineligible request into an outage.

The contract
------------
In order:

1. **Make it work.**  A request shape the lane could serve is not a reason to
   stand aside.  Greedy was the motivating case: it looked like an unservable
   shape and it was not -- ``argmax`` over the pre-scattered rows is the same
   ``argmax`` as over the full-vocabulary row, so
   ``MTPLX_QWEN4_DRAFT_K20_PRESCATTER`` now serves temperature-0 requests on
   the greedy chain instead of refusing them.  Reach for the two outcomes
   below only after establishing the lane genuinely cannot serve the shape.
2. **Install-time contract violation -> RAISE.**  The armed flag cannot work
   in this process at all: FR-Spec is not installed, the head is not on the
   live draft route, the ranked table is the wrong width or not ascending, the
   pinned NumPy is missing, the pack's weights are the wrong shape.  Every
   request would fail identically, so this belongs at startup with a precise
   reason -- it is a deployment error, not a request.  Raise it where the
   thing being validated exists (model build, weight load, route install),
   NOT on whichever request happens to reach the check first.
3. **A genuinely different selector -> ROUTE.**  Some lanes only exist for one
   kind of request: the device draft chain and device K20 consume PCG64
   uniforms and a fixed top-k support, which a greedy request has none of;
   block verification is a speculative-sampling acceptance ladder, and a
   greedy window has no draft distributions to build one from.  The request is
   served -- by the shipped path, or by that shape's own optimised path -- and
   the lane records that it stood aside.  This is routing, not refusal, and it
   is only correct when the shape has no analogue in this lane AND the
   optimisation is not lost where it does apply.

Each lane's module docstring carries a table saying which request shape gets
which path.

A routing decline is NOT a silent fallback.  ``installed`` stays False, the
receipt carries ``declined`` (a stable key) and ``declined_detail`` (the
sentence), one line per reason per process goes to stderr beside the lanes'
own install receipts, and :data:`DECLINE_COUNTS` accumulates per flag and
reason for the life of the process, so an operator can see how often a flag
stood aside and why.

Benchmarks keep their fail-closed guarantee
-------------------------------------------
``MTPLX_STRICT_CLAIMS=1`` turns every decline back into the lane's own
``*Ineligible`` exception.  A measured arm that must PROVE its lane ran sets
it; a server never does.  Read once at import, like every other PR #391 gate.

NO device work happens here, and nothing in this module imports MLX.
