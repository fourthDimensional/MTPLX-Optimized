"""Page-residency-aware row gathers for the PLE n-gram sidecar.

Pure Python + NumPy + ctypes: no MLX import, nothing here runs on the GPU,
and every function is safe on a worker thread (the memmaps are read-only and
``mincore``/``madvise`` go through ``ctypes.CDLL``, which releases the GIL).

Why this module exists
----------------------
``_SidecarGather.prepare_rows_np`` opens every big gather with a threaded
``os.pread`` warm pass, then does the real read as one NumPy fancy index over
the memmaps.  On a page-cache-warm table the warm pass is the whole cost:

===============================  ==========  =========
formulation (32,768 rows)        pread warm  memmap fx
===============================  ==========  =========
shipped (step<=64, 512 tasks)      164.8 ms    0.62 ms
**no warm, memmap only**           **0 ms**    0.44 ms
===============================  ==========  =========

That is ~5 us of GIL-contended Python per ``os.pread``, times three maps times
the chunk's unique rows -- the syscall count IS the cost, so no batching or
page-dedup formulation moves it (measured J/W4).

Dropping the warm pass unconditionally is not safe.  Demand-faulting an mmap
is FLAT at 1.40 GiB/s however many threads touch it, while pooled ``pread``
saturates at 12.9 GiB/s (measured 2026-07-11, `mmap-willneed-unwired`): on a
COLD table the fancy index degenerates into serial faults *with the GIL held*,
which stalls the generation thread as well.  The 2026-08-26 receipt puts that
at ~36 s serial vs ~7.5 s pooled for a cold 100k-token prefill.

So the choice is measured, not assumed: :func:`warm_decision` samples the rows
this gather will actually read and asks ``mincore(2)`` whether their pages are
already in core.  A false "cold" costs nothing (it takes the shipped pread
path); a false "warm" is the expensive mistake, so the threshold is high and
an unavailable/erroring probe answers "pread".
