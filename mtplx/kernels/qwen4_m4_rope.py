"""One-dispatch partial RoPE for the Qwen3.8 Flash-Next fixed-M4 verifier.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
W69's node census of the compiled fixed-M4 verify body found ``qsa_rope`` --
the rotary embedding applied inside the twelve QSA layers -- to be the largest
fusable glue group in the graph.  On today's stack
(``MTPLX_QWEN4_OPDIET=1`` with the ``rope`` item, ``MTPLX_QWEN4_QSA_M4``
**off**) one QSA layer issues its rotation as a chain of small elementwise and
copy dispatches:

    positions = pos_start + arange(S)                       arange, add
    angles    = positions.astype(f32)[:,None] * inv_freq    2 fused elementwise
    cos, sin  = mx.cos(angles), mx.sin(angles)              2 (siblings)
    lo, hi    = the two half-width multiply-adds            2 per rotated tensor
    out       = concatenate([lo, hi, pass])                 3 copies per tensor

``Attention.__call__`` rotates TWO tensors with that one table -- the query
``[1, S, 24, 256]`` and the key ``[1, S, 2, 256]`` -- so the attention half of
a QSA layer is 4 table dispatches + 2 x 5 rotation dispatches (+ the 2 that
build ``positions``), all of it zero-byte work around 6 k of activations.

This module issues the same arithmetic as ONE dispatch that rotates both
tensors: 14-16 dispatches and ~7 dependent levels become 1 and 1.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
* **No RMSNorm.**  ``qsa_indexer_prepare.py`` fuses norm + rope because the
  indexer's ``head_dim`` is 128 and MLX's ``rms_single_row`` reduction (32
  lanes x 4 contiguous values) is reproducible exactly only up to 128.  The
  attention head_dim here is **256**, so ``q_norm``/``k_norm`` stay outside.
* **No M-RoPE tables.**  A row whose three position axes differ (an image
  row, which only a prefill forward can write) keeps the stock chain; on a
  stock cache the caller routes around this kernel while
  ``vision_rope_state()`` is live.  The decode rows of an image request DO
  come through here on the fixed lane: past the last image all three axes are
  the sequence index plus one delta, which is this kernel's own arithmetic at
  ``pos_start = offset + delta``.  The caller passes the bank's rotary origin
  (``TensorOffsetQSACache.rope_offset``, one int32 value, a graph input of the
  verify trace) and this module never reads the request context.
* **No indexer query prep and no pooled bank row.**  Those two rope sites of
  the same QSA layer already have shipped, pinned-bit-exact kernels
  (``qsa_indexer_prepare_queries_metal`` and ``qsa_m4_pooled_row``); see
  ``MTPLX_QWEN4_VERIFY_GLUE_ITEMS=qsa_rope_idx`` and ``MTPLX_QWEN4_QSA_M4``.

NUMERICS
--------
The target is the LIVE stock expression, which is
``_rope_cos_sin_half`` + ``_apply_partial_rope_half`` when the op diet's
``rope`` item is armed and ``_rope_cos_sin`` + ``_apply_partial_rope``
otherwise.  The two are bitwise-identical to each other by construction
(``mtplx/models/qwen4_exp.py``), and this kernel reproduces either:

    theta   = (float)(int32(pos_start) + row) * (float)inv_freq[pair]
    cosine  = precise::cos(theta) * ROPE_ATTENTION_SCALE
    sine    = precise::sin(theta) * ROPE_ATTENTION_SCALE
    lo      = (T)(first * cosine  - second * sine)
    hi      = (T)(second * cosine + first  * sine)
    pass    = the input value, copied

``mx.cos``/``mx.sin`` lower to the Metal *precise* variants (unlike
``mx.fast.rope``, which deliberately uses fast trig), so this kernel uses
them too.  ``lo`` matches the stock ``x1*cos + (-x2)*sin`` bit for bit because
IEEE negation is exact: ``(-x2)*sin == -(x2*sin)`` and ``a + (-b) == a - b``.
The four products are kept as distinct fp32 locals for the same reason
``qsa_indexer_prepare.py`` does: letting Metal contract ``a*b - c*d`` into an
FMA changes a handful of bf16 cutoff values.

That is the same construction whose bit-exactness against the eager chain is
pinned in ``tests/test_qsa_indexer_prepare_metal.py``.  It is NOT a proof
against the *compiled* body, where MLX fuses the multiply-add chain into a
kernel of its own whose contraction behaviour we do not control.  So the
install probe in this module is ``mx.array_equal`` against the live eager
expression and the microbench (``the PR #391 harness micro_verify_glue_a.py``)
re-checks against the compiled one; a probe miss DISABLES the item and logs
rather than raising, because rope rounding is a numerical verdict, while a
contract miss (geometry, dtype, rotary width) always RAISES.
