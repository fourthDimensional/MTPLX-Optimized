"""Multi-axis (M-RoPE) position tables for vision requests.

Qwen-VL-family models rope image tokens at (t, h, w) grid positions while
text tokens advance all three axes together; text after an image resumes at
max+1, so the image occupies max(frames, rows, cols) positions rather than
one per token ("position contraction"). Serving image tokens with plain
sequential positions diverges from training.

The table is a pure function of the expanded prompt (ids + per-image grids):
it is recomputed per request and never persisted in cache state, so warm
restores stay format-stable. Decode continues with equal-axes positions at
sequence_index + delta, which is exactly plain rope shifted by delta — the
scalar decode path stays untouched.

Algorithm adapted from mlx-vlm's get_rope_index (MIT, Prince Canuma and
contributors), simplified to batch-1 text+image serving (no attention-mask
padding, no video).

# v1 was implicit: builds 2.10.1 to 2.11.3 wrote these entries under the same
# unsalted key as sequentially roped ones. Those builds opened the position
# scope around the main verify forward only, so the rows their copy rounds,
# repairs, lazy bonus commits and final commits wrote sit |delta| positions
# off, inside entries nothing else tells apart. v2 entries are written with
# every trunk forward inside the scope. A v1 entry can no longer match at or
# past an image; nothing is deleted, it ages out through normal eviction.
