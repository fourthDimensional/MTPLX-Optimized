"""``MTPLX_QWEN4_SAMPLED_DRAFT_CHAIN`` -- the sampled draft chain, one eval per round.

The problem
-----------
At ``temperature > 0`` the stock draft loop is strictly serial.  Every draft
depth runs one MTP forward, blocks on one ``mx.eval`` of its K20 support, builds
the proposal distribution on the host, draws the token with the request's NumPy
generator, and only then can the next depth's forward be built, because that
forward consumes the drawn token.  Depth 3 therefore costs three blocking
syncs per round before the verify sync, and the GPU idles while the host builds
and encodes each next depth.  The one-eval chain in ``generation.py`` exists for
greedy requests only, where the next token is an ``argmax`` the device can take
by itself.

What this module does
---------------------
It lets the device *predict* the host's draw so the next depth can be chained
without a sync, and lets the host *prove* every prediction afterwards:

1. Before the round the host draws the ``D`` uniforms the serial lane would
   have drawn, in the same order from the same generator (``Generator.choice``
   with ``p=`` draws exactly one ``random()`` double and does a right-sided
   ``searchsorted`` on the normalized cdf; :func:`host_pick` is that, and
   ``tests/test_qwen4_draft_device_chain.py`` pins the equivalence).
2. On the device, per depth: the K20 support of the FR-Spec head's compact
   65,536-row output (never the 248,320-lane scatter), the nucleus filter, the
   id-ascending cdf, and the inverse-cdf pick for that depth's uniform, all in
   float32.  The picked id feeds the next depth's forward as a lazy array.  One
   ``mx.eval`` materializes all depths.
3. On the host, per depth, the SAME arithmetic the serial reader runs (float64
   cumulative sums, ``cumulative_before < top_p``, id-ascending renormalized
   distribution) on the same three device arrays, and the same inverse-cdf
   pick.  The host result is the authority: it is the token that is drafted and
   the distribution that enters the acceptance ratio.
4. If the device's float32 prediction ever disagrees with the host's float64
   pick (a uniform within rounding distance of a cdf edge), the chain is cut at
   that depth: the MTP cache is rolled back to the offset recorded before the
   first forward that consumed the wrong token, and the remaining depths run
   serially with the already drawn uniforms.  Nothing downstream ever sees a
   device-only decision.

Exactness
---------
The drafted tokens, the proposal distributions and the generator stream are,
by construction, exactly those of the serial compact-row reader
(:func:`serial_read`), for every seed: same candidates, same float64 host
arithmetic, same uniforms in the same order.  The device prediction is never
trusted, only confirmed.  Against the older dense-row reader the proposal
``q`` can differ by a few ULP of ``logsumexp`` (a 65,536-lane reduction against
a 248,320-lane one whose extra lanes contribute exactly ``+0.0``; see
``qwen4_draft_k20_prescatter``), which moves ``q`` and never the output law:
the acceptance ratio is taken against the ``q`` the token was really drawn
from.

Cutoff ties follow ``MTPLX_QWEN4_RELAXED_DRAFT_TIES`` semantics (the Flash-Next
lane default): the support is ``argpartition``'s top ``k`` with no tie proof
superset, so which of several *exactly equal* logits at the cutoff enters the
support is the partition's choice.  Whatever that choice is, it is the support
the token is drawn from and the support the ratio sees.

NO device work happens at import.
