"""One-slot lookahead for the PLE n-gram prefill gather.

Pure Python + NumPy: no MLX import, no MLX array is created or evaluated
anywhere in this module, and nothing here runs on the GPU.  The worker thread
this module owns produces RAW NUMPY ROWS only; the generation owner thread
turns them into MLX arrays.

The problem
-----------
Every prefill chunk opens with a synchronous PLE n-gram gather:
``NGramEmbedding.stage`` hashes the chunk's 2,048 token ids into 32,768 sidecar
row ids and calls ``_SidecarGather.gather_np``.  The census (scratchpad
J-prefill-attribution, cb-sorted i in [432, 7151)) finds eight host-late GPU
stalls, one immediately before each chunk's ``gather_frontbfloat16_int32_int_2``,
totalling **2,313 ms** -- 96% host-late, GPU fully idle -- against 158 ms of
in-chunk idle for everything else.  The gather's own GPU cost is 3.5 ms.

What the stall actually is
--------------------------
Measured host-only, at the production row geometry (16 ngram heads/token,
head_dim 160, q4/g32 -> three maps of 80/10/10 bytes per row), on a
page-cache-warm file (production runs prewarm the table):

===============================  ==========  =========  ==============
formulation                      pread warm  memmap fx  per map, total
===============================  ==========  =========  ==============
shipped (step<=64, 512 tasks)      164.8 ms    0.62 ms       165.5 ms
16 big batches                     175.6 ms    0.52 ms       176.2 ms
one pread per distinct page        183.6 ms    0.92 ms       184.6 ms
**no warm, memmap only**           **0 ms**    0.44 ms      **0.44 ms**
===============================  ==========  =========  ==============

``np.unique`` on the 32,768 ids is 1.4 ms.  So the stall is **not I/O and not
NumPy**: it is ~5 us of GIL-contended Python per ``os.pread``, times 3 maps
times the chunk's unique rows.  No batching, offset-precomputation or
page-dedup formulation moves it -- the syscall count is the cost.  Dropping
the warm pass is not an option either: it exists for the COLD case (the
``_SidecarGather`` docstring's 2026-08-26 receipt: 36 s serial faults vs 7.5 s
pooled on a cold 100k-token prefill), and warmth is not knowable cheaply.

So the fix is to move the whole preparation off the critical path.  Every
prompt token is known before chunk 0 runs, so chunk k+1's row ids, unique set,
page warm and raw row read can all happen on a worker thread while chunk k's
48-layer forward occupies the GPU for ~1.2 s.  The owner thread then only
builds the MLX arrays.

Exactness
---------
The worker runs the same expression the owner would have run --
``np.ascontiguousarray(map[unique])[inverse]`` over the same read-only memmaps
with the same ids -- so the bytes are identical by construction.  The prepared
payload is accepted only after its span's token ids compare equal to the ids
``stage`` was actually called with; a mismatch discards the payload and takes
the ordinary path, counted, never silently.

The hot-row LRU is owner-thread-only state, so the worker path is restricted
to gathers that bypass it (``len(unique) > _SidecarGather._HOT_PATH_MAX_ROWS``)
-- which is every real prefill chunk, and is checked rather than assumed.
