"""Acceptance-EMA adaptive draft-temperature controller (``MTPLX_ADAPTIVE_DTEMP``).

HYPER-PLAN §15 ship shape for the dtemp lever: *"register-dependent, not
ctx-dependent … ship as acceptance-EMA adaptive controller, never a fixed
default."*  Env-gated, default OFF.

Mechanism (10:50 PDT entry): sharpening toward 0.85 pays when the MTP head
ranks right-but-diffuse (natural/formulaic register — base pos-1 acceptance
sags into the ~.70-.76 band) and costs when the head is confidently matching
already (duplication-heavy register — base pos-1 >= ~.80, where min(1, p/q)
starts rejecting agreeing tokens as q sharpens past p).

Exactness: the draft temperature shapes only the PROPOSAL distribution q; the
house probability-ratio acceptance with residual correction derives p and q
independently, so the output marginal is exact for any q — including a q whose
temperature moves mid-stream.  Changing dtemp mid-stream changes trajectories
(documented, fine: this is a speed/tuning lane, not a correctness lane).

The schedule — two set-points, state-dependent hysteresis
---------------------------------------------------------

Observation per round: the pos-1 accept *probability* ``min(1, p/q)`` of the
round's first chained draft position (continuous in [0, 1]; same expectation
as the receipt ladders' pos-1 acceptance rate, far lower variance than the
0/1 accept coin).  Rounds that did not draft through the sampled MTP lane
(context-copy streak/block rounds, no-draft rounds) contribute nothing.

* SEED: the first ``seed_rounds`` observed rounds run at the request-resolved
  base temperature; their plain mean seeds the EMA ("seed from the first N
  rounds at the current default temp").
* EMA: ``ema <- (1 - alpha) * ema + alpha * x`` per observed round.
* State DEFAULT (dtemp = resolved base):
  RAISE -> BOOST (0.85) when ``floor <= ema <= raise_threshold`` (0.45..0.78).
  Receipts: 0.85 helps at base pos-1 .71-.758, hurts at .802 — the band edge
  sits between .758 and .802, so raise at <= .78.  Below the .45 floor there
  are no receipts at all: hold the shipped base in unmeasured territory.
* State BOOST (dtemp = 0.85):
  DROP -> DEFAULT when ``ema < drop_threshold`` (0.70).  The thresholds are
  state-dependent because the lever itself moves the operating point: under
  0.85 the hurt case reads .683 while every help case reads .717/.77/.889 —
  the boundary between them is ~.70.
* Hysteresis, three layers:
  1. the state-dependent bands (raise at <= .78 from DEFAULT, drop at < .70
     from BOOST — an 8-point gap);
  2. the plant's own response reinforces both decisions (boost SHIFTS pos-1
     acceptance +.06..+.14 where it helps — away from the drop edge — and
     -.12 where it hurts — decisively through it);
  3. a dwell floor: at least ``dwell_rounds`` observed rounds between
     transitions, which caps flip rate at band edges under EMA noise;
  4. a Schmitt re-arm on the raise trigger: after a BOOST -> DEFAULT drop
     (the hurt signature fired), the raise rule stays DISARMED until the
     EMA first recovers ABOVE the raise threshold.  Without this, the
     post-drop EMA climbing from the boost-arm's ~.68 reading back to the
     duplication register's ~.80 default reading would transit the raise
     band and re-boost into the same register that just hurt (a sustained
     ~2x-dwell oscillation).  Re-arming requires the default-state reading
     the receipts show for that register (>= ~.80); a LATER sag back into
     the band then marks a genuine register change and raises legitimately.

Interaction contract (documented, enforced by the build gate in
``generation.generate_mtpk``):

* Greedy draft chain / greedy coupling: the chain requires BOTH the target
  and draft samplers at temperature <= 0 and is pre-bound per request.  The
  controller activates only when both are > 0 and its set-points are all
  > 0, so the pre-bound chain decision can never go stale and the controller
  never un-greedies a greedy draft.
* Device draft cores (``draft_core`` "device"/"device-d2"): those compile the
  draft sampler INTO the core (temperature baked into the sampling graph,
  and the rebuild signature does not include it), so a mid-stream change
  would silently draft at a stale temperature.  The controller refuses to
  run there (``draft_core != "stock"`` blocker) instead of desyncing.
* fsleg / FR-Spec legacy (``MTPLX_FRSPEC_LEGACY``): composes freely — the
  pruned-head remap happens AFTER the draft sampler shapes and samples q, so
  the controller's temperature applies to the shortlisted logits the same
  way (08-25 attribution matrix: zero interaction between the two levers;
  the fsleg 120k acceptance drop was dtemp's alone).
* Research draft lanes that replace the sampled proposal (adaptive width
  policy's greedy d1/d2, draft margin threshold, adapter ensemble, top-k
  reranker, target-prefix verify, grammar constraints): blocked — pos-1 is
  either not sampled from the draft sampler there or acceptance is clamped,
  so both the lever and its observable are invalid.

Telemetry: the per-request summary (``summary()``) rides GenerationStats as
``draft_sampler_adaptive_dtemp`` and is stamped into the public mtplx_stats
and the request-log envelope only when non-empty (quiet-envelope idiom), so
disabled runs stay byte-stable.  Each transition also lands in the round
event stream as ``adaptive_dtemp_transition``.
