"""One resolver, three entry points (PX.1, 2026-09-18).

The macOS app, ``mtplx start`` and bare ``mtplx serve`` each carried their
own copy of the launch lane, and the copies had drifted: Pi got the
``ar_batch`` scheduler from the app and ``serial`` from the CLI, the SSD
session-cache cap was a literal 100 GB on ``serve``, 32 GB on ``start
opencode`` and RAM-tiered from the app, ``start hermes`` forwarded stale
4.8 / 6.0 ms depth-policy priors and exported read-inspection limits the app
had removed, and a saved Adaptive depth switch sent the expected-value
policy to Flash-Next, where only verify width 4 has a compiled route.

This module owns the lane. Given (client, model family, memory, chip class,
entry point) it resolves: scheduler mode, prefill chunk, depth and policy,
SSD session cache and its cap, sampler, reasoning effort, agent env block.
The CLI start tables are generated from it, the server resolves the depth
policy through it, and the app's presets are tested against the matrix it
emits (``lane_matrix``; the Swift test reads the JSON fixture).

Pure data and arithmetic: no MLX import, no server import, no subprocess.
