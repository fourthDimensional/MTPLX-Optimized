"""Fork-EV shadow telemetry — HYPER-PLAN Phase-3 H2 gate pricing (2026-08-26).

Answers "does margin-triggered B2 fork EV clear +10% whole-decode?" WITHOUT
building the tree: an observe-only accounting layer on the linear mtpk accept
loop (env ``MTPLX_FORKEV_TELEMETRY=1``, default off). It extends the
``MTPLX_DELTA_TELEMETRY`` instrument (commit 2010018b: correction-rank-in-
draft-candidates on every rejection) from unconditioned hit counting into a
margin-conditioned fork-EV simulator with a threshold policy sweep.

Trajectory neutrality
---------------------
The recorder never touches the RNG, never mutates draft/target state, and only
reads host-side NumPy arrays the lane already materialized
(``SparseDistribution.probs`` / ``.token_ids`` — the same arrays the
Δ-telemetry reads). Disabled: a single env read per generate call and one
``is not None`` check per round. Enabled: pure-NumPy top-2 on <=top-k-sized
sparse supports — zero extra MLX evals, zero graph changes. Draft
distributions that are NOT sparse-materialized (greedy lanes, dense arrays)
are never inspected; they count as ``margin_unavailable``.

The shadow B2 tree being priced
-------------------------------
At a low-margin drafted position r (1-indexed, K drafts in the round) the real
H2 design forks the draft into its #1 and #2 candidates and verifies both
branches in one forward (NAX extended window / shared walks). The shadow
prices a SAME-DEPTH tree: the linear chain keeps its K positions; branch2
enters at r and continues to the same total depth K, i.e. it owns
``h = K - r`` continuation slots. A real implementation may grant branch2 more
window — the same-depth choice is the conservative floor.

Accounting semantics (what counts as saved tokens)
--------------------------------------------------
Linear lane at a rejection r: commits (r-1) accepted drafts + the
residual-sampled correction c, round ends.

* hit := (c == draft's #2 candidate at r). The residual sample landing on the
  draft's #2 candidate is the observable proxy for "the tree's second branch
  would have been walked" — the identical proxy behind the Δ-telemetry
  receipts (depth1 .087 / depth2 .286 / depth3 .429, n=21), so the
  conditioned numbers stay comparable to the unconditioned ones.
* The hit token itself is NEVER counted as saved: the linear lane also
  commits a token at position r (the correction); a fork changes which
  mechanism commits it, not the count.
* On a hit with h >= 1 the tree walks branch2's continuation. Every branch
  node's target row is inside the same verify forward, so the walk commits
  its accepted run j plus one terminal token (residual correction at the
  first branch rejection, or the leaf bonus when all h accept):
  ``j + 1`` extra tokens, ``j in [0, h]``.
* j is unobservable (branch2's continuation was never drafted). Proxy: the
  NEXT linear round starts from the identical committed state ([..., c] with
  c == c2) and its accepted-draft run a' measures model/draft agreement from
  that exact state. Known bias: a' is measured at shallow MTP depths (1..K')
  while branch2's continuation sits at deeper recursive depths (r+1..K)
  where acceptance decays, so a' over-estimates j.
* Estimators (all streamed):
    - ``saved_hi = 0 if h == 0 else 1 + min(a', h)``
      the true same-depth tree shape (run proxy + terminal token, <= h+1).
      Upper bracket of the same-depth pair.
    - ``saved_lo = 0 if h == 0 else 1 + min(a', h - 1)``   [PRIMARY]
      keeps the structural +1 — the row after c2 is in the forward and is
      exactly the row the linear lane's next-round primary samples, so
      committing one token from it requires no draft to be right — then
      burns one continuation slot: forgoes the leaf bonus and tightens the
      depth-mismatched run proxy by one. Bound: ``saved_lo <= h = K - r``
      ("a fork can never save more than the slots it had").
    - ``saved_ext = 1 + a'``  (EXTENDED-window tree)
      report 6 §14 prices branch2 with its OWN continuation budget beyond
      the linear chain (NAX flattens M so wider/deeper verify is near-free:
      "branch-2 budget-4", QL9/D8). Under budget >= a'+1 the branch chain
      commits its proxied run plus one terminal token, uncapped by h. This
      is the estimator the deepest-fork economics need — under the
      same-depth cap a depth-K rejection (the HIGHEST hit-rate cell, Δ3
      = .429) prices at zero by construction. Assumes the branch budget
      covers the observed run; the same-depth pair brackets from below.
* h == 0 (rejection at the deepest draft position): a same-depth tree has no
  continuation slots there — saved_lo = saved_hi = 0 even on a hit;
  saved_ext still prices it.
* Resolution timing: saved needs a', so a hit parks a pending record resolved
  by the next observed round. A pending still open at generation end
  resolves to saved = 0 (the stream ended; nothing followed to save) and is
  counted in ``pending_unresolved``.

Policy sweep (per threshold T over the draft margin)
----------------------------------------------------
margin := q1 - q2 of the draft sampler's SHAPED sparse distribution — the
exact q the acceptance test uses, already on host. Support of 1 => margin 1.0
(fully confident, never triggers). At draft-temp 0.1 expect margins
concentrated near 1.0; hence the sweep reaches down to 0.05.

* fired(T): the round has >= 1 drafted position with margin < T (fork cost
  side — how often the trigger spends window budget).
* "first" variant — single fork budget: fork at the FIRST low-margin
  position; benefit only when the round's model rejection lands exactly
  there AND hits.
* "at_rejection" variant — fork at every low-margin position (window budget
  permitting): benefit whenever the rejection's own margin < T and hits.
  This is the margin-CONDITIONED analogue of the unconditioned n=21
  receipts — the number report 6 §3's arithmetic needs.
* EV tokens/round = saved_sum / rounds_observed  (lo and hi).

Exclusions (each separately counted, never silently dropped)
------------------------------------------------------------
* grammar-clamped rejections (``constraint_clamped``): the branch would face
  the same grammar mask; pricing them as fork wins would be fiction.
* rejections without a sparse draft distribution: ``margin_unavailable``.
* rounds that bypass the standard accept loop (context-copy block commits,
  pre-verify continues): simply never observed — the denominator is
  "verify rounds through the standard accept path".

Env knobs
---------
* ``MTPLX_FORKEV_TELEMETRY=1``  master gate (mirrors ``_env_truthy``).
* ``MTPLX_FORKEV_THRESHOLDS="0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5"``  optional sweep
  override (comma-separated floats in (0, 1]).
