"""Block verification (Sun et al. 2024, arXiv:2403.10444) for the stock lane.

NO MLX.  Pure NumPy on host rows the stock native-MTP accept loop has already
built for its own decision.  This module never evaluates an ``mx`` array, never
draws a random number, and never touches the device.

Why
---
``H-tokens-per-window-design.md`` §Option B.  The shipped law decides depth
``d`` from ``x_d`` alone::

    alpha_d = min(1, rho_d)          rho_d = p_d(x_d) / q_d(x_d)

and that is already saturated at depth 1 (H §3.1: exactness forces
``q(x) A_1(x) <= p(x)``, so no law can accept the first draft more often).  The
slack is one clip deeper.  The whole M4 verify forward is finished before the
accept loop runs, so **all** target rows and the full-depth draft chain are on
the host when depth 1 is decided.  The decision may therefore legally look at
``rho_2`` and ``rho_3``; the only exactness constraint is on the *marginal*
reach probability::

    Abar_d(x_{1:d}) <= Abar_{d-1} * rho_d(x_d)   and   Abar_d <= 1

Clipping the running product instead of clipping each factor and multiplying,
and spending the resulting budget preferentially on the realisations whose
*next* drafted token the target likes, is block verification.  Measured offline
on 381 real windows: **+1.85% tokens/window (2.487 -> 2.533)**.

The law, exactly as implemented
-------------------------------
``tests/block_verify_reference.py`` is the float64 reference and
this module is its in-loop mirror -- same arithmetic, same tie ownership.
Per window, with ``Abar_0 = 1`` and ``w_{-1} = w_0 = 1``::

    for d in 1..D:
        rho_d  = p_d(x_d) / q_d(x_d)                   # 0 when the target
                                                       # zeroed the drafted token
        A_d    = min(1, Abar_{d-1} * rho_d)            # nominal reach budget
        Abar_d = min(w_{d-1}, A_d)                     # FEASIBLE budget: only
                                                       # realisations that reach
                                                       # depth d can spend it
        if d < D:
            base(y) = min(1, Abar_d * rho_{d+1}(y))    # y over draft row d+1
            lam_d   = water-fill level s.t.
                      sum_y q_{d+1}(y) * min(w_{d-1}, base(y) + lam_d) = Abar_d
            w_d     = min(w_{d-1}, base(x_{d+1}) + lam_d)   # REALISED reach
        else:
            w_d     = Abar_d
        a_d = w_d / w_{d-1}                            # CONDITIONAL accept coin,
                                                       # a probability by construction
        if u_d <= a_d:  continue
        emit sample(normalise((Abar_{d-1} * p_d - w_{d-2} * q_d)+))  # residual
        stop
    emit bonus ~ p_{D+1}                               # unchanged

Why this is exact (a two-line proof the enumeration test pins).  Given the
window reached depth ``d-1``, the draft at depth ``d`` arrives with the
reweighted law ``q_d(y) w_{d-1}(y) / Abar_{d-1}`` (the look-ahead at depth
``d-1`` spent its budget unevenly over ``y``), and the expected reach at depth
``d`` for draft ``y`` is ``E_{x_{d+1}}[w_d] = min(w_{d-2}, A_d(y))``.  So the
accepted mass at ``y`` is ``min(q_d(y) w_{d-2} / Abar_{d-1}, p_d(y)) <= p_d(y)``
pointwise and the residual is exactly the deficit
``(p_d(y) - q_d(y) w_{d-2} / Abar_{d-1})+``.  Both use only quantities the
ladder already carries.

The previous form of this law (2.11.1, off in production because the flag
was frozen at import before the server stamped it) took the raw ``A_d`` as the
budget at the last depth, clipped the resulting ``a_d > 1`` coin to 1, and used
``(A_{d-1} p_d - q_d)+`` as the residual.  Enumerated against the target law on
tiny vocabularies that is exact at depths 1 and 2 and off by up to 4e-2 total
variation at depth 3 (``tests/test_block_verify_exact_law.py``); the two
missing factors above are the whole difference.

**The c = 1 identity.**  When the ladder never drops below 1 the two laws
coincide token for token: ``a_d`` collapses to ``min(1, rho_d)`` and the
residual to ``(p_d - q_d)+``.  That holds on 43-47% of windows (H §1.2), and it
is the partial parity check a staged rollout gets for free -- the offline
scorer fails if it ever stops holding.

Draw accounting -- unchanged
----------------------------
Block verification consumes **exactly the same randomness as the shipped law**:
one accept coin per depth reached, one ``rng.choice`` for a correction, one for
the bonus.  Nothing in this module takes an RNG.  The water-fill is
deterministic, so arming the flag cannot shift the PCG64 stream for a given
outcome path (``mtplx/pcg64_tape.py``'s ``DRAWS_PER_CYCLE`` is a PR391-lane
constant and is untouched either way).

Row preparation
---------------
Rows arrive as ``SparseDistribution`` / dense arrays that the stock lane has
already shaped (temperature, top-p, top-k, renormalised -- ``sampling.py``).
:func:`prepared_pair` applies exactly what the reference's ``prepared_row``
applies to the *logged* copies of the same arrays: drop the zero-probability
entries, sort by token id ascending, renormalise once.  Same inputs, same
operations, same order -- so the in-loop ladder is bit-identical to the
offline reference's, which is what makes an armed K20 log replayable as an
exactness proof rather than a smoke test.

What ``accept_probability`` means when armed
--------------------------------------------
``a_d``, the **conditional** accept probability of depth ``d`` given the window
reached it.  That is the same thing the shipped law's ``min(1, rho_d)`` is (the
probability the coin at that depth accepts), so ``accept_probability_sum_by_depth``
and ``drafts[].accept_probability`` keep their arithmetic meaning; what changes
is that under BV the value depends on the depth ``d+1`` rows as well as on
``x_d``.  It is no longer an estimate of the TV overlap ``beta_d``: H §1.2's
``E[alpha] = beta`` identity is a property of ``min(1, rho)`` and does not
survive the water-fill.  Read ``alpha_uncensored`` out of the offline scorer
for that.
