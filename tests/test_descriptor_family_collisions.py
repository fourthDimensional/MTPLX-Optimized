"""Family-marker collision fences (F21/F22, 2.8 charlatan-defensibility).

F21: stock Qwen3 sizes collide with the Qwen 3.8 version token. In
``Qwen/Qwen3-8B`` the ``-8B`` is a parameter count, not a version, but the
plain ``qwen3-8`` substring marker claimed it for the qwen3_8 family — wrong
sampler (temp 1.0 vs stock 0.6), wrong draft temperature, wrong reasoning
codec, and MTPLX takes the accuracy blame on someone else's model. Boundary
rule: the version token ``qwen3[._-]?8`` immediately followed by a digit-run
ending in ``b`` is a size (8B, 80B), never the 3.8 family.

F22: a renamed or symlinked directory must classify by what the artifact SAYS
it is (mtplx_runtime.json forge provenance), not what the folder is called.
Provenance outranks the resolved path, which outranks the ref as spelled.

NOTE: no family marker in any test name here — pytest bakes the test name
into tmp_path, and a "qwen38" in it would taint every resolved path.
