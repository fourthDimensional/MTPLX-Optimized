"""Live-reference leases must be visible to every budget and releasable.

Issue #456 (and the memory half of #499, and the kernel panics cited by
PR #500). When a snapshot is over the per-session byte budget, ``put()`` keeps
a "live-reference lease" instead: the entry pins the turn's whole live cache
and used to record ``nbytes=0``. Every guard in the bank is byte based, so a
lease was invisible to all of them:

* ``total_nbytes`` read 0, so the server's admission shed (gated on
  ``bank_bytes_now > 0``) skipped shedding and reported "nothing sheddable";
* ``shrink_to_bytes`` loops on ``total_nbytes > target`` and never ran;
* the dynamic ceiling computes ``working = active - weights - bank bytes``, so
  the lease inflated the working set and the guard evicted the useful durable
  snapshots while the actual holder stayed;
* leases were exempt from supersede in both directions and from per-session
  retention, so a lease the next turn could not consume stayed for good while
  the turn allocated a fresh cache. One leaked cache per turn.

Measured by peterloron on a 64 GB M4 Max (27B, q8 paged KV): +3.7 GiB of
``active`` per turn with ``session_bank.entries: 4, total_nbytes: 0``.

These tests drive the real put/restore contract; nothing fabricates entries.
