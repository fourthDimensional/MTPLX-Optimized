"""Score the block-verification law (H §Option B) against the shipped law,
offline, on the K20 rows captured by ``MTPLX_QWEN4_K20_LOG``.

Why offline, and which number to read
-------------------------------------
``H-tokens-per-window-design.md`` §1.4: ``Var(l) ~ 1.50`` at ``n ~ 385`` gives
``SE(E[l]) = 0.062``, i.e. **+-4.2% (1 sigma)**.  Both candidate laws move
``E[l]`` by a few percent, so a live A/B cannot resolve them.  A replay on
logged rows fixes the rows, which removes most of that; two estimators are
reported, and they are not interchangeable:

**``E[tok/win]`` -- the one to quote.**  ``1 + sum_d w_d``, where ``w_d`` is the
probability the window accepts through depth ``d`` given the rows and the
drafted tokens.  No uniform is consulted, so the accept-coin variance is
integrated out analytically; and the block law's ladder reports the closed-form
``E[w_d | x_{1:d}] = min(A_d, w_{d-1})`` rather than the realisation, which
integrates out the look-ahead draw as well.  What is left is the drafted-row
sampling, which is *identical* for both arms -- and at depth 1 the two ladders
are then provably equal entry for entry, which is the theorem (H §3.1: depth-1
acceptance is already saturated at ``min(1, rho_1)`` and no law can raise it).
The reported ``delta`` is the paired per-cycle difference with its own standard
error, and that interval is several times tighter than either arm's own.

**``replay`` -- the exactness proof.**  The full emission simulation, driven by
the four **logged PCG64 uniforms**, so it reproduces the token the device
would have emitted.  This is what compares each law's decision against the
device kernel's own logged output and what verifies the ``c = 1`` identity.
Its arm-to-arm difference is noisy (the two laws' coins land differently on
the same uniform), so read it for correctness, not for magnitude.

Two lanes, one loader
---------------------
``MTPLX_QWEN4_K20_LOG`` writes one normalised schema from either of the two
lanes that make an accept decision, and this script loads both.  The only
place they differ is how far the rows have already been shaped, which
:func:`build_window` branches on and nothing else does:

``pr391_raw``
    Rows are the softfloat64 kernel's **raw** input -- top-20 ids, raw logits,
    full-vocabulary softmax.  Top-p 0.95 and the double renormalisation are the
    kernel's, so this script re-runs them (:func:`prepare_row`,
    :func:`prepare_batched_row`), mirroring
    ``pr391_softfloat64_verifier_decision.py`` line by line.
``stock_prepared``
    Rows are the stock native-MTP lane's host-side ``SparseDistribution`` /
    ``BatchedSparseDistributions`` objects, which are **already** shaped and
    renormalised (``sampling.py:122-176``).  Re-running the kernel's
    preparation would apply top-p a second time, so :func:`prepared_row` takes
    them as they are.  Two further consequences:

    * the correction id is sampled with ``rng.choice`` straight off the live
      generator, so it is not reproducible offline -- the replay self-check
      compares everything *except* the selected token;
    * an accept coin exists only for the depths the lane actually reached, so
      :func:`window_uniforms` fills the rest from a deterministic stream seeded
      by the window's own logged PCG64 state.  Both laws get the same stream.

What is replayed, and what is not
---------------------------------
Each logged cycle carries one verify window's prepared K20 rows and its
decision uniforms.  This script re-decides **that window**
under each law.  It does **not** re-run the model: under the block law a
window can accept a different number of tokens, which in production would
change every subsequent window's rows.  So the number reported here is a
**per-window counterfactual on the realised row distribution** -- the standard
and correct estimator for ``E[l]``, and the same framing H §3.4 uses for its
surrogate.  It is not a full-trajectory simulation and must not be sold as one.

The two laws
------------
**Current** -- ``mtplx/kernels/pr391_softfloat64_verifier_decision.py:220-345``,
mirrored here in float64::

    for d in 1..3:
        rho_d = p_d(x_d) / q_d(x_d)
        alpha_d = min(1, rho_d)                       # kernel line 280-287
        if u_d <= alpha_d: accept                     # kernel line 289, `<=`
        else: emit sample(normalise((p_d - q_d)+))    # kernel lines 296-306
    emit bonus ~ p_4                                  # kernel lines 335-342

**Block verification** -- H §3.2.  One clip moves: the running product is
clipped at 1 instead of each factor being clipped and then multiplied, and
depth ``d``'s accept coin is allowed to look at the depth ``d+1`` rows::

    Abar_0 = 1 ; w_{-1} = w_0 = 1
    for d in 1..3:
        rho_d  = p_d(x_d) / q_d(x_d)
        A_d    = min(1, Abar_{d-1} * rho_d)           # nominal reach budget
        Abar_d = min(w_{d-1}, A_d)                    # FEASIBLE budget (cap 'reach')
        if d < 3:
            base(y) = min(1, Abar_d * rho_{d+1}(y))   # y over the d+1 draft support
            lam_d   = solve_lambda:  sum_y q_{d+1}(y) * min(cap, base(y) + lam) = Abar_d
            w_d     = min(cap, base(x_{d+1}) + lam_d) # realised reach probability
        else:
            w_d     = Abar_d
        a_d = w_d / w_{d-1}                           # CONDITIONAL accept coin
        if u_d <= a_d: continue
        emit sample(normalise((Abar_{d-1} * p_d - w_{d-2} * q_d)+))   # deficit residual
        stop
    emit bonus ~ p_4

The residual is the deficit the coins leave: given reach d-1 the draft at d
is proposed with law ``q_d(y) w_{d-1}(y) / Abar_{d-1}`` and its expected reach
is ``min(w_{d-2}, A_d(y))``, so the accepted mass is
``min(q_d(y) w_{d-2} / Abar_{d-1}, p_d(y))`` and what is left is exactly
``(p_d - q_d w_{d-2} / Abar_{d-1})+``.  ``tests/test_block_verify_exact_law.py``
enumerates the emitted joint law against the target on tiny vocabularies; the
2.11.1 form (raw ``A_d`` at the last depth, coin clipped at 1, residual
``(A_{d-1} p_d - q_d)+``) fails that test at depth 3 by up to 4e-2 TV.

``lam_d`` is the water-filling level that keeps ``E_{x_{d+1}~q_{d+1}}[w_d]``
exactly at the budget ``A_d`` -- which is what preserves exactness: the
position-``d`` accept probability, averaged over the *next* drafted token,
still equals ``min(1, rho_d)``, so ``q_d(y) * P(accept | x_d = y) <= p_d(y)``
holds pointwise and the residual stays non-negative.  Within that budget the
mass is shifted toward the realisations whose next drafted token the target
likes, which is the entire gain.

**One correction to H's pseudo-code, made explicit.**  H writes the water-fill
cap as a literal ``min(1, ...)``.  With that cap ``w_d`` can exceed ``w_{d-1}``
(a good ``x_{d+1}`` can ask to reach depth ``d+1`` more often than depth ``d``
was itself reached), and then ``a_d = w_d / w_{d-1} > 1`` is not a probability.
Two caps are implemented:

``--cap reach`` (default)
    Cap the water-fill at ``w_{d-1}``.  ``w_d <= w_{d-1}`` by construction,
    ``E[w_d] = A_d`` still holds exactly (feasible because
    ``w_{d-1} >= A_d``), and the coin is always a probability.  This is the
    smallest change that makes H's law well defined and budget-exact.
``--cap one``
    H's literal cap, with ``a_d`` clipped at 1.  The clip wastes budget, so
    this arm is a lower bound; the report counts how often the clip binds.

Both caps coincide whenever ``w_{d-1} = 1``, so both reproduce the current law
exactly on the ``c = 1`` windows (H §3.2: "when c = 1 the law is bit-identical
to today's"), which the report verifies rather than assumes -- and fails on if
it ever stops holding.  Holding it needs one piece of float64 care: when the
budget reaches the cap the water-fill has exactly one solution (everything
saturates), and computing it as ``lam = cap - min(base)`` and adding it back
returns ``0.9999999999999999`` often enough to break the identity on a couple
of windows per four hundred.  :func:`_block_realised_reach` short-circuits that
case to ``cap`` instead.

Arithmetic and tie ownership (mirrored, with citations)
-------------------------------------------------------
All of it is float64, from ``pr391_softfloat64_verifier_decision.py``:

* row preparation ``_prepare_batched_candidate_row`` (lines 33-77):
  rank by ``lexsort((ids.astype(uint64), -values.astype(float64)))`` -- score
  descending, **id ascending on a score tie**; keep ``probs > 0``; top-p by
  ``cumulative_before < top_p`` (**strict**, and computed on the raw
  full-vocabulary probabilities, i.e. the mass *before* the entry); normalise
  once by ``first_total``; return **sorted by token id ascending**;
* ``_prepare_candidate_row`` (lines 88-105) adds the second normalisation
  ``_renormalize_sparse_probabilities`` (lines 80-86).  **Draft rows get the
  double normalisation, target rows only the single one** (lines 246-265);
* ``alpha`` uses the *single*-normalised target row (line 281) while the
  residual uses the *double*-normalised one (line 297).  Both are mirrored;
* accept on ``u <= alpha`` -- line 289, ``<=``, so a draw exactly equal to the
  accept probability **accepts**;
* ``_sample_prepared`` (lines 138-149): ``cdf = cumsum(p); cdf /= sum(p);``
  ``index = min(searchsorted(cdf, u, side="right"), n - 1)`` -- ``side="right"``
  means a draw exactly equal to a CDF breakpoint lands in the **next** bucket,
  and the final clip owns the ``u`` above the last breakpoint;
* ``_prepare_residual`` (lines 165-197): ``union1d`` of both supports,
  ``max(p - q, 0)``, drop non-positive, normalise twice; when nothing survives,
  fall back to the double-normalised target row (lines 303-306);
* a stop token accepted at depth ``d`` ends the window with
  ``draws_used = d + 1`` and no selected token (lines 290-303);
* ``q <= 0`` for a drafted token yields ``alpha = 1 if p > 0 else 0``
  (lines 282-284) -- unreachable in practice, mirrored anyway.

Self-check
----------
Before scoring anything, the replay is compared against the decision the run
**actually returned** for every logged cycle (``accepted`` / ``first_reject`` /
``selected_token`` / ``selected_kind`` / ``draws_used``).  A single mismatch is
a hard failure: it means this file no longer mirrors the lane, and every number
below it would be worthless.  ``--allow-replay-mismatch`` downgrades it to a
warning for debugging.

Which law that replay uses is a property of the log.  A ``pr391_raw`` or
``stock_prepared`` log ran the shipped law, so :func:`decide_current` is the
oracle.  A ``stock_prepared_bv`` log was produced with
``MTPLX_QWEN4_BLOCK_VERIFY=1``, so :func:`decide_block` is -- per window, since
a window that could not arm (a row the lane never materialised) fell back to
the shipped law and records ``block_valid = 0``.  An armed log carries the
in-loop ladder as well, and :func:`block_ladder_columns` recomputes it here and
demands entry-for-entry equality: that is the exactness proof that
``mtplx/qwen4_block_verify.py`` implements the law in this file, and it is what
a BV-armed run must show.
